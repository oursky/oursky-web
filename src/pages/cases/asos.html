          Oursky worked with ASOS to create a custom browsing experience where
          4,000 new items are published weekly.

        <h5>The Need: A tailored fast-fashion shopping experience</h5>

        <p>
          ASOS, one of the largest global online retail stores, sells over
          75,000 designer and private-label clothes and accessories through
          localized mobile and web experiences in almost every country in the
          world. To further enrich their users’ shopping experience, they wanted
          to create an app that can help customers browse new arrivals — 4,000
          products are added weekly. ASOS worked with Oursky to create an iOS
          app that would showcase a daily feed of all the store’s new items.
          ASOS wanted to provide something more than just an app — they
          envisioned a mobile experience that would excite on-the-go customers
          when scrolling for updates.

        <h5>
          Oursky’s Strategy: Develop a customer-centric mobile browsing
          experience integrated into enterprise APIs
        </h5>
        <p>
          Oursky began working on ASOS' product by creating a proof-of-concept
          iOS app. We created the “NEW IN” ASOS daily feed that could showcase
          the 4,000 new items that ASOS brings in every week. For the frontend,
          we focused on a customer-centric user interface (UI) that had
          prominent catalogue images, smooth swiping animations, and convenient
          features like enabling users to share content on social media. We used
          Objective-C for iOS and integrated it into ASOS’ backend APIs. In our
          integrations, we included features, such as letting users save items
          for later purchase, in ASOS’ desktop and mobile sites. We also
          designed the app to capture behavioral data so ASOS can better
          understand customer preferences and serve content or items that they
          may be interested in.
        </p>

        <h5>Results: Seamless, on-the-go shopping experience</h5>

        <p>
          Oursky delivered an on-demand app solution that met ASOS’
          requirements. Through concerted effort from our development teams, we
          created an app whose features were seamlessly integrated into ASOS’
          own backend, giving their shoppers more convenience. After the app’s
          pilot release in the U.K. and Denmark, ASOS rolled out the “NEW IN”
          app globally.

            The Oursky team has been great to work with. They provided accurate
            estimates on the work required and always delivered on time despite
            the time difference and location. The cross-team communication was
            always effective. Their organized approach to the product
            development and on-hand support when issues arose were brilliant and
            I’d definitely recommend and work with them again.
